<h1>S&P RNN with LSTM Time Series Prediction </h1>

<h3>Running the Code</h3>

- <i>LSTM_Network.py</i> contains all the required code with comments (LSTM network with 2 hidden layers)
- <i>5yr-SP-data.csv</i> contains 5 columns of data pertaining to and including the S&P closing values
- The input is the data given above and the output of the code is the expected S&P value for the following day
- The netwok just needs to be run with the input data, various parameters can be changed such as the number of epochs and the number of nodes in the hidden layers
